00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,486
<i>And this year</i>

12
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,390
<i>I ruined Christmas.</i>

13
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,225
<i>Christmas is by far</i>

14
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,960
<i>the most stressful
time of the year for moms.</i>

15
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,163
<i>There are a million
things to do.</i>

16
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,231
<i>And you have to do them
all perfectly</i>

17
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,466
<i>or else you will
never forgive yourself.</i>

18
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:45,669
<i>And more importantly,
neither will your kids.</i>

19
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:47,038
<i>I literally feel like</i>

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,740
<i>the worst mom
in the world right now.</i>

21
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,183
<i>Maybe I should start
at the beginning.</i>

22
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:06,223
<i>I've always loved Christmas.</i>

23
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:09,160
<i>It's my favorite
time of the year.</i>

24
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,366
<i>Most of all, I love
the time with my family.</i>

25
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,568
<i>Because all I want</i>

26
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,671
<i>all any mom wants</i>

27
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,106
<i>is for their kids to have

<i>That said, Christmas is
an insane amount of work.</i>

31
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,416
<i>First, you have to buy gifts</i>

32
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,619
<i>for every human being
you've ever met.</i>

33
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,356
<i>I gave my coffee guy
a scented candle this year.</i>

34
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,459
<i>Why did I do that?</i>

35
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,594
<i>Then, you have to decorate
your house</i>

36
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,796
<i>which, clearly, I suck at.</i>

37
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:48,266
I'm doing the best I can,
Charmaine!

38
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,369
<i>Then, you have to go to
all your kids' Christmas shows</i>

39
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,637
<i>which are...</i>

40
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,475
<i>Yeah.</i>

41
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,543
<i>Then, there's all the
over-the-top Christmas parties.</i>

42
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:00,811
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

43
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,714
<i>Are these lobster Santa hats?</i>

44
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,316
<i>Are these a thing now?</i>

45
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,417
<i>What the fuck?</i>

46
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,386
<i>Then, there's all the cooking</i>

47
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,322
<i>all the cleaning</i>

48
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,889
<i>all the wrapping.</i>

49
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,091
<i>It's insane!</i>

50
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,460
<i>There's just never enough time.</i>

51
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,828
Argh!

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,672
- Hi, mom.
- Hey.

53
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,940
- Hey!
- How was the game?

54
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,407
It was great! The Bulls won.

55
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,078
- Yes! Congratulations.
- Yes!

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,411
- Hi, honey.
- I love you, baby.

57
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,847
Wow. Your house
looks really great.

58
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,183
Oh, thank you.

59
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,317
I still-I still got
lots left to do, but...

60
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,653
Can I do anything to help?

61
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,020
No, no, not unless
you know how

62
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,788
to magically fix
Christmas lights.

63
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,257
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

64
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,826
Yeah, you just
swap out the fuse.

65
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,627
It's pretty easy.

66
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,496
That's pretty hot. I won't lie.

67
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,933
Oh, you're definitely getting
the gold-star treatment tonight.

68
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,501
I like that,
but hold that thought.

69
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,672
Okay.

70
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,941
Oh. Your dad is awesome.

71
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,709
I thought you hated him.

72
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:08,213
What? No, honey, what?
Why would you say that?

73
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,715
When you came over
to the house last week

74
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,284
I heard you and daddy
in the bedroom

75
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,655
and you kept
screaming at him.

76
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,822
Oh, yeah.

77
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,490
No, honey, those were...

78
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,991
Those were happy screams.

79
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,994
They didn't sound happy.

80
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,529
And then you punched the wall

81
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,864
and yelled the F-word.

82
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,201
Okay, I-I, um...

83
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,734
Yeah, I don't,
I don't really recall

84
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,237
doing that, so, yeah.

85
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,572
- I don't know if that happened.
- You did.

86
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,407
You were like,
"Oh, my fucking God!"

87
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,909
Just like that.

88
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,376
"Oh, my fucking God!"

89
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:41,479
Okay, alright. Shh! Shh!

90
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,748
Um, here's the thing.

91
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,516
Your dad and I
were just playing a fun

92
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,751
little grown-up game.

93
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,420
You played the game seven times.

94
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,722
Six and a half.
But who's counting?

95
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,691
Here's the thing,
let's just not...

96
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,924
Let's just not talk about this.

97
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,193
- Cool?
- Cool.

98
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,031
- High-five. Awesome.
- Got it.

99
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,537
Oh, no.

100
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:05,873
What is it?

101
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,409
My mother's
coming for Christmas.

102
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,876
Oh, my fucking God!

103
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,753
Thanks for helping me decorate
the tree, guys.

104
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,088
Bernard, let's hang 'em
on the tree. Okay, buddy?

105
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,890
Oh, who put the big
brown ornament

106
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,391
right on the front
of the tree?

107
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,527
- It looks like doodie.
- Yes, it does, baby.

108
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,395
And that's why mommy's
gonna move it around back.

109
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,797
Oh, no, sweetie

110
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,465
we don't drink
the tree water.

111
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,700
We don't drink the tree water

112
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,035
'cause we're people, right?

113
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,136
Mommy, is there a Santa Claus?

114
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,604
<i>You bet there is, buddy.</i>

115
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,475
- I know.
- Are you lying to me, mommy?

116
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,309
Oh, God, make it stop.

117
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,946
What else have you lied about?

118
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,814
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, dad.

119
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,549
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

120
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,920
- You alright?
- Yeah.

121
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,720
- Tree looks great.
- Thank you.

122
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,321
- Want me to feed the twins?
- Yes, please.

123
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,391
- Hey, buddy. Good to see you.
- Thank you.

124
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,424
- Let's get some food.
- It's okay, buddy.

125
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,458
Aw, it's alright.

126
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,068
Hah! Merry Christmas, Kiki!

127
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,306
- Mom? Hi!
- Oh... my... gosh!

128
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,275
I thought you weren't
coming until Friday.

129
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,643
Well, I just hopped
on an earlier flight.

130
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,080
- Three days earlier?
- Oh.

131
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,282
I-I haven't made up
the guest bedroom or anything.

132
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,619
That's okay.
I'll just sleep with you.

133
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,420
Big spoon, little spoon.

134
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,323
I usually sleep
with my husband now.

135
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,361
Hey, you wanna see
the sweatshirt I made?

136
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,662
I love this picture.

137
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,498
And look, you were just getting
your little tiny breasts.

138
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,366
- Well, one of 'em, anyway.
- You just got here.

139
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,701
Let's not talk about my breasts.

140
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,302
- Then the other one popped out.
- Yeah.

141
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,338
Thank goodness!

142
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,506
Oh, Keeks!

143
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,643
If you play your cards right,
you could get

144
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,311
a sweatshirt just like this
for Christmas.

145
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,280
Oh, no.

146
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,982
Oh, Kiki Dee,
I cannot wait

147
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:02,119
to spend every waking minute

148
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,987
of the next three weeks
with you.

149
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,290
Hmm...

150
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,057
Oh!

151
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,194
Hmm...

152
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,328
Are you smelling my hair?

153
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,963
Yes.

154
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,573
Oh, my God.

155
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,408
If I have to wax
one more pussy today

156
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,143
I'm gonna black out.

157
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,912
Since when did
every woman in America

158
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,549
need a completely hairless
vagina on Christmas?

159
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,489
Anyone else here for a wax?

160
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,991
Oh, my God,
that's like 50 more vaginas.

161
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,395
Okay, who's next?

162
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,330
Oh, no, not you, sasquatch.

163
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,665
I can't handle you right now.

164
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,570
<i>Hmm, let's see.</i>

165
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,376
Oh. You. Betty White.

166
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,609
I'm intrigued.

167
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,780
Come with me.

168
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:17,128
Hey, what's up, lady?

169
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,763
- Mom?
- Ha-ha!

170
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,898
Wait, what the actual fuck?

171
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,802
Oh, my God!

172
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,472
Ah! My God! My God!

173
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,874
Oh, my God!

174
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,443
Wait, I... Well,
you didn't tell me

175
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,212
you were coming for Christmas.

176
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,213
It's Christmas?

177
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,881
Uh, yeah.
Isn't that why you're here?

178
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,751
Totally! Totally why I'm here.

179
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,220
Merry Christmas, lady.
Merry Christmas.

180
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,254
Jesus, look at you!

181
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,790
You bitch,
you don't age at all.

182
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,225
Look how fucking hot you look!

183
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,626
Look at those boobs.

184
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,395
Oh, thanks. You're lookin'
a little bit older.

185
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,330
But good, you look good.

186
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,066
What's it been,
like three years?

187
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,467
Three?

188
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,136
Whoa, really?

189
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,404
Oh, gosh. I don't know, babe.

190
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,737
I don't really know
what year it is.

191
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,641
Why are you wearing
black pajamas?

192
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:07,978
Oh, uh... No, yeah, I, uh...

193
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,981
I work at a spa.

194
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,150
You have a fucking job?

195
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,753
Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,521
I'm tryin' to be more
responsible and shit.

197
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:21,528
Oh, you always were so weird.

198
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,762
So why are you really here, mom?

199
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,765
What do you mean?

200
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,300
Well, you only come
when you need money.

201
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:32,169
Uh, oh... No, no, no.

202
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,038
I don't gamble anymore.

203
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,472
No, I'm just here to see

204
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,974
my daughter on Easter.

205
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,611
- Christmas.
- Christmas.

206
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,445
So I think we should celebrate.

207
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,115
I know, Thunder Down Under

208
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,150
is playing by the airport.

209
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,122
I think we should hit that hard.

210
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,622
- Male strippers?
- Yeah.

211
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,625
- With my mother?
- Mm-hm-hm.

212
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,059
On Christmas?

213
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,196
Yeah.

214
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:59,163
How could I say no?

215
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,332
Let's go slap
some wieners, bitch!

216
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,635
- Alright! That's my girl.
- Whoo!

217
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,203
Oh, my God, Jaxon is gonna

218
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,137
shit himself when he sees you.

219
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,640
Still got that kid, huh?

220
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:09,841
Yup, yup.

221
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,476
How old is he now?

222
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,477
Oh, 15 or 17.

223
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,682
- Oh, cute, cute.
- Yeah.

224
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,586
So your mom and dad have never

225
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,687
been here
on Christmas before?

226
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,822
Um, no, no.

227
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,723
<i>Okay, wait, do you, do you
think that I made enough food?</i>

228
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:28,226
Uh, seriously?

229
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,593
I can make quiche.
I'm gonna go make quiche.

230
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,563
Babe, everything's
gonna be fine.

231
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,865
No, honey,
it's not gonna be fine.

232
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,868
My mom is the most critical
human being on the planet.

233
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,203
When I was six years old

234
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,005
I made her a birthday card.

235
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,573
And she returned it with notes.

236
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,775
Okay, that's fucked up.

237
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,443
The point is she's perfect

238
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,112
at everything and she is
impossible to please.

239
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,546
But if she's
impossible to please

240
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,615
why're you tryin' so hard
to please her?

241
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,049
Listen, I'll tell you the truth.

242
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,217
Daughters spend
their whole lives trying

243
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,551
to please their mothers,
and mothers

244
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,687
spend their whole lives

245
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,221
shitting all over
their daughters.

246
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,357
It's just how the world works.
Okay? I can't fix that.

247
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,626
I'm not,
I'm not fucking Beyoncé.

248
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,861
Well, y-y-you are to me.

249
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,029
- Ugh.
- I love you.

250
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,097
I love you.

251
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,632
- Mmm.
- Okay.

252
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,967
You think your mom's
gonna like me?

253
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,068
No.

254
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,704
I'm sorry we're late.

255
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,439
Hank drives like a girl.

256
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,540
Merry Christmas,
grandma and grandpa!

257
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,875
Merry Christmas, grandpa!

258
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,910
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

259
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,078
Merry Christmas, dad.

260
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,879
Here, have some X-Boxes.

261
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,548
- Are you serious?
- Thank you so much.

262
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,982
Mum would never let us
have these.

263
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,818
<i>Thank you.</i>

264
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,252
Hi, Ms. Redmond, I'm Jessie.

265
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:30,722
It's so nice to meet you.

266
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,993
Please take the bags
upstairs. <i>Gracias.</i>

267
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,094
Okay. Hi, mom.

268
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,630
- Amy.
- Hi.

269
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,097
- You look pale.
- Oh.

270
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,632
I'm just trying out
a new skin thing.

271
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,067
Oh, good, it's just bad makeup.

272
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,135
You're not dying.

273
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,435
Where's your tree?

274
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,304
I-I haven't had time
to get one yet.

275
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,073
Amy, it's December 19th.

276
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,476
Even the Jews have
Christmas trees by now.

277
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,809
Never mind,
we'll get one tomorrow.

278
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,945
- Okay.
- Huh.

279
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,280
Yeah. Do you have any food?

280
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:58,915
I haven't eaten
in three days.

281
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:01,519
Yeah. Oh, gosh, yes. I actual...
I have all your favorites.

282
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,621
It's adorable.

283
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,158
You let your kids cook.

284
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,026
Okay.

285
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,796
Oh, I didn't know Rite Aid
made Christmas decorations.

286
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,665
So I have the whole week
planned out.

287
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,534
On Thursday,
we'll see "The Nutcracker."

288
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,770
And then, of course, on Friday,
we'll all go caroling.

289
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,671
Unfortunately,
Mike was our baritone

290
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,140
and you're divorcing him.

291
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,007
So we're gonna have to fill
that hole

292
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,110
if we're gonna win
the Caroling Cup this year.

293
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,779
Oh, God, the Caroling Cup?

294
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,447
Darling, when I lived here

295
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:33,317
we won the Caroling Cup
nine times.

296
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,685
It's too bad
you've given up on

297
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,453
our family's
tradition of winning.

298
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,555
Yeah, I guess I've just
been a little busy, so...

299
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,059
Well, clearly not
at the gym. Whoop.

300
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,129
<i>I want to celebrate my
triumphant return to Chicago.</i>

301
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,698
I wanna throw an enormous
Christmas party at your house.

302
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,668
So I was thinking Christmas Eve,
if that's convenient.

303
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,870
What? No.
That's not convenient.

304
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,905
I mean, we can invite
all of my old friends

305
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,641
and we can have a sushi station

306
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,241
and we can hire Kenny G

307
00:12:58,243 --> 00:12:59,711
to play Christmas music.

308
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,679
I hear he's not even
that expensive anymore.

309
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,847
Yeah, okay, that-that sounds
like a lot of work.

310
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,516
Yeah. It's too bad,
I've already invited everyone.

311
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,185
- Where, to my house?
- Yes.

312
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,254
A 184 people are coming.

313
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,521
What?

314
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:12,823
Why haven't I gotten
a Christmas card

315
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:13,857
from you yet?

316
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,193
I don't know, mom.

317
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,761
I-I-I guess it just fell
through the cracks.

318
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,429
What is happening with you?

319
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,896
Nothing.
Nothing's happening to me.

320
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,265
Amy, this is Christmas.

321
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,233
It's the big show.

322
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,837
- I know.
- You can't dick around.

323
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,738
- I'm not dicking around.
- I feel you're dicking around.

324
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,339
Mom, I'm honestly
not dicking around.

325
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,741
Yes, you are dicking around.

326
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,009
I can tell
when you're dicking around.

327
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,544
I'm not dicking around.

328
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,879
- Dick, dick around.
- Okay.

329
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,914
Okay.

330
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,116
I'm not dicking around.

331
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,251
Alright, enough
with the bad language.

332
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,285
Okay.

333
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,621
- I like your hair.
- Really?

334
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,424
Yeah, it looks like
you're not trying so hard.

335
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,195
Yeah. Love you.

336
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,300
Oh...

337
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,806
I can't do Christmas
with my mother.

338
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,240
It's like living
with Saddam Hussein.

339
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,641
My mom is only staying
with me

340
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,910
because I think
she wants to steal my TV.

341
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,578
Oh, I have to go
Christmas tree shopping

342
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,945
with my mother tonight.

343
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,147
Yeah, it's like,
it's like going

344
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,116
on a seven-hour death march

345
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,284
around the city.

346
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,418
My daughter really wants

347
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,087
a Happy Happy Princess Doll

348
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,222
and I have looked everywhere

349
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,892
for it and I don't know
where it is.

350
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:24,629
Where is she, guys?

351
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,063
Where is Happy Happy Princess?

352
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,564
Oh, my God.

353
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,833
I know it's just a doll,
but God.

354
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,469
Christmas is
killing me this year.

355
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,972
Holy fuck.

Me neither.

You guys wanna get drunk
at the food court?

- Yeah.

- Ooh, fun!

367
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,641
You guys, you know
what drives me crazy?

368
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,275
- Genital warts?
- What?

369
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:14,277
- Genital warts.
- No.

370
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,512
Carla, no.

371
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,048
No, w-w-what drives me crazy

372
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,549
is the-is the pressure
that we put on ourselves

373
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,717
to make Christmas perfect, guys.

374
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,453
Look, Christmas
is supposed to be fun.

375
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,822
Yes, why am I responsible

376
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,723
for getting
every gift for everyone

377
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,391
in my entire family?

378
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,727
I mean,
just 'cause I'm a girl?

379
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,395
- Yeah.
- It's 2017!

380
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,463
I thought so.

381
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,496
Why can't my husband

382
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:34,866
buy presents for his own mom?

383
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,067
I don't even like his mom.

384
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,801
She blames her farts on my kids.

385
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,002
- What?
- <i>You know what I do?</i>

386
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,670
- With my big dumb son?
- What?

387
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,906
Every November,
I just go into his room

388
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,809
grab a bunch of random crap

389
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,577
wrap it up,
give it to him on Christmas.

390
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,212
- He doesn't even notice.
- Seriously?

391
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,746
Oh, my God, I've given him
the same baseball glove

392
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,515
like nine times.

393
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,851
And how lame are the gifts
that your family gives you?

394
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,254
I spend months picking out
the perfect gift

395
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:59,089
for everyone in my family
and all I ever get

396
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,058
is coupons
for free back rubs.

397
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,059
Oh, that's so wrong.

398
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,694
You know what my son gave me
last year for Christmas?

399
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:06,997
A box of Ziploc baggies.

400
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,565
Think I'll probably
just wrap it up

401
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,568
and give it back to him again
this Christmas.

402
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,505
You guys, I'm just like
a-a-a giant stress ball

403
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,607
from November to New Year's.

404
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,377
I just wanna enjoy
Christmas again.

405
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,280
Yeah.

406
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,184
Well, then let's do it.

407
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,419
What?

408
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,853
Guys, what is wrong with us?

409
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,789
Have we learned nothing?
This is bullshit.

410
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,858
I am disappointed
in this threesome.

411
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,727
We are mothers.

412
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,195
And if things are not going
our way, then what do we do?

413
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:41,031
We hide in the bathroom.

414
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,266
- No.
- No.

415
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,601
No, we don't,
we don't do that.

416
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,636
- Uh-unh.
- We s... No, we stand up.

417
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,204
- <i>And we fight back.</i>
- Fight back. Yes.

418
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:51,809
So if we wanna do Christmas
our way this year

419
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,578
then we're gonna do
Christmas our way.

420
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,881
No more perfect gifts,
no more perfect decorations

421
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,382
no more perfect anything.

422
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,953
- Fuck it.
- Let's take Christmas back.

423
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,754
Let's put the "ass" back.

424
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,424
- In "Christm-ass."
- What?

425
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,092
That didn't come out exactly as
I planned, but y-you guys get...

426
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,895
- Yeah, we know what you meant.
- Yeah, we get you.

427
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,563
Okay, to taking Christmas back.

00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:27,864
- Yes.
- You guys ready?

483
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,234
- Look at that.
- Okay.

484
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,402
- This is really nice, mom.
- Yeah.

485
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,071
We should do all Christmas
like this.

486
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,106
Yeah, can we just
hang out together

487
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,409
and skip all the annoying stuff?

488
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,410
Yeah, you guys, I...

489
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,379
I would actually
really like that.

490
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,985
Hey, Jessie, you should come
over on Christmas.

491
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,151
Um, yeah, yeah.

492
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,553
I don't know.
It's kind of a big deal.

493
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,287
I wouldn't want to impose.

494
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,289
Don't be weird, dad.

495
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,492
We'll be here.

496
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,162
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

497
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,131
Yeah, I would
actually love that.

498
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,335
- Me, too.
- Okay.

499
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,137
Good evening, everyo...

500
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,305
<i>What in God's name is that?</i>

501
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,408
Oh, that is our
new Christmas tree.

502
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,977
I got it at Lady Foot Locker.

503
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,844
- <i>Do you like it?</i>
- No, I don't, Amy.

504
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,314
- I find it revolting.
- Oh.

505
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,850
What is this thing
doing in your house?

506
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,084
I don't know, I-I didn't wanna

507
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,452
waste time tree shopping
this year.

508
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,188
I actually wanted
to enjoy Christmas.

509
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,956
Amy, you are a mom.

510
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,992
Moms don't enjoy,
they give joy.

511
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,493
That's how being a mom works.

512
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,763
And this hideous tree
does not give joy to anybody.

513
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,533
I don't know,
I-I kind of like it.

514
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:36,699
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

515
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,968
Who are you,
and why are you talking?

516
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,538
Mom, please be nice.
This is Jessie. You met him.

517
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,340
<i>I'm tired of this conversation.</i>

518
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,775
But if you think for one second

519
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,810
I'm gonna let
your lazy shenanigans

520
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,711
ruin Christmas
for this entire family

521
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:51,015
you are very much mistaken.

522
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,483
Goodnight, dear children.

523
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,618
Here, have some
iTunes gift cards.

524
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,153
Mom, seriously? You have to
stop giving them gifts.

525
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,455
<i>Thanks, grandma.</i>

526
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,957
Honey, did you see
these ornaments?

527
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,624
They are all little shoes.

528
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,892
I swear to God, Hank.

529
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,394
I will drive you
to a fire station

530
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,133
and I will leave you there.

531
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,472
- Hi.
- Hi.

532
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,372
How was your night?

533
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:17,675
- So good.
- Yeah?

534
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:18,879
Yeah.

535
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,217
Mmm.

536
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,918
You taste like grape soda.

537
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,887
I know. I had a Welch's
right before bed.

538
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,162
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

539
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,668
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

540
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,004
Mom!

541
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,538
Hi, guys.

542
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,173
What are you doing in here?

543
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,176
Well, I just came in here
to watch you fall asleep

544
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,710
like I always do
and then you started

545
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,080
going at it
like monkeys in a zoo.

546
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,715
You watch me fall asleep
every night?

547
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,449
Well, except after
Blue Bloods, I know

548
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,884
that's your
special intercourse night.

549
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:04,521
Oh, honey,
I'm so glad to see

550
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,457
you have such a vibrant
sex life.

551
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,726
It's so important
for you and Kent

552
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,296
to just bang each other.

553
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,429
And Kent.

554
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:15,865
I am so happy

555
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,401
that you're able to get
an erection again.

556
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,571
Yay!

557
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,805
And Kiki.

558
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,541
He's so much bigger
than your dad was.

559
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,075
Okay, mom, thanks, you can go

560
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:28,077
before my husband never
has sex with me again.

561
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,316
Yup.

562
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,749
Oh, and, honey

563
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,285
your dad liked it
when I tickled his balls.

564
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,120
Okay, you need
to stop talking.

565
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,920
I'm gonna come check on you guys
in a little while.

566
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,593
Oh, please don't.

567
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,064
Oh, wow.

568
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:50,900
- You need to talk to your mom.
- I know.

569
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,969
She needs some boundaries.

570
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:56,239
- Or at least, a boundary.
- I know.

571
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,508
I just, uh...

572
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,678
I don't wanna hurt
her feelings.

573
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,246
And, you know,
ever since my dad died

574
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,682
I'm, like, pretty much
her only family.

575
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,951
So I'm worried that if I
push her away even a little

576
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:11,689
that it's gonna break
her heart.

577
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,192
She saw my boner, Kiki.

578
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:15,761
Yeah.

579
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,537
Oh, my God. What the...

580
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:34,178
What... the fuck?

581
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,362
Okay, bring the French hens

582
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,564
three inches to the left.

583
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,699
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

584
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,137
Mom?

585
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,471
What are you doing?

586
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,306
I am decorating
your house properly

587
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,209
because apparently, you are
unwilling to do so yourself.

588
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,478
Why does my house
have to be properly decorated?

589
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,814
Making Christmas special
is how you show

590
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,483
your family
that you love them, Amy.

591
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:13,917
You don't want
your kids to think

592
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,252
that they're worthless
and unloved.

593
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,019
- Do you?
- Well, no, of course not.

594
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:19,523
This is the time of year
when moms kill themselves

595
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:22,359
to create a magical world
of joy for their children.

596
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,428
It is not a time of year
when moms sit around

597
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,862
in their pajamas
eating fudge.

598
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,531
- I don't even like fudge.
- Great.

599
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,198
So stop being a shitty mom.

600
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,700
- Oh.
- Hey, kids.

601
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,835
How do you like
the Christmas cavalcade, huh?

602
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:35,339
- Oh, my gosh. It's awesome.
- Show mom how it works!

603
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,541
Really, Amy,
you are gonna love this. Okay.

604
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:41,277
We are go for
the cavalcade, over.

605
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,348
Don't worry, I'll show you
how this works. It's on an app.

606
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,887
Oh, you installed
outdoor speakers.

607
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,558
Shh-shh, wait for it,
wait for it.

How much did this cost?

615
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,473
How can you put a price tag

616
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,941
on a child's happiness, Amy?

617
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,878
- It was very expensive.
- God! Mom!

618
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,381
Wait for it,
this is the big ending!

619
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,221
Are those actual partridges?

620
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,789
Of course.

621
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,592
They don't have
any survival skills.

622
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,061
They'll be dead within an hour.

623
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,295
- Okay.
- Here, kids.

624
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,398
Have some breakfast candy.

625
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,099
- I'm sorry, what?
- Oh, my God.

626
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,567
Thank you, grandma.
I love you.

627
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,403
I love you.
I love you, too, guys.

628
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,104
Okay, let's reload the birds.

629
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:43,140
And I hate that they're gray.

630
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,740
Let's paint them all white.

631
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:46,776
And can't they look
a little happier

632
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,111
when they fly away?

633
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,181
I mean, it is Christmas.

634
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,917
<i>Your mom decorated your house?</i>

635
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,186
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That is not okay.

636
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,522
Who cares, let her
decorate your house.

637
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,823
She wanna do mine next?

638
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,324
It's-it's not about the house.

639
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,759
It's-it's about the fact
that I'm a 34-year-old woman

640
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:06,496
and my mother is still telling
me how to live my life.

641
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,266
Well, then you need
to fight her.

642
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,802
Like... physically?

643
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,370
That is correct, Amy.

644
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,005
I can teach you
some basic karate moves.

645
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,773
But we all know that
she's gonna keep treating you

646
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,208
like this until you beat
the shit out of her.

647
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,210
I don't want you to meet my mom.

648
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,980
She's a 62-year-old woman,
so...

649
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,381
Fine, but you need to have

650
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,717
at least a serious
conversation with her.

651
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,519
- That sounds more legal.
- I know. I know.

652
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,621
And where's your dad
in all this?

653
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,489
Oh, my dad, he's so sweet.

654
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:34,858
But he's completely
under her control.

655
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,192
I mean, there's no way
he's gonna choose

656
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,727
my side over hers, no.

657
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,464
- Sweetie, that's hard.
- Oh...

658
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,966
Moms are so weird.

659
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,002
How's Christmas with your mom?

660
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:47,204
Oh, you know. It's...

661
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,406
It's okay-it's okay,
I guess. Yeah.

662
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:52,308
I mean, my mom got her hair cut

663
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,977
and colored exactly
like mine, but...

664
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,813
I think that's pretty
normal, right?

665
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,582
Your... Did your moms...

666
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:02,252
Do your moms have
your... hairstyle?

667
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,755
You know, every time

668
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:07,356
I think I'm the fucked-up one
in this group

669
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:11,862
Kiki, you open your mouth,
and then I'm like

670
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,598
"No, I'm doing great."

671
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,834
Anyway, uh, my mom and
I were gonna

672
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:20,571
take the kids over
to Sky Zone later.

673
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:22,171
- Do you guys wanna come?
- Legally...

674
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,508
I can't get within
50 yards of a Sky Zone but...

675
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,544
Okay, you know what?
Fuck it. I'm totally in.

676
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,712
- Amy?
- Oh, I can't-I can't go.

677
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,448
I wish I could,
but my mother's making us

678
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,050
go see "The Nutcracker." So...

679
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:35,451
- I love "The Nutcracker."
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

680
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,787
Not like the Sugar Plum Fairy
"Nutcracker."

681
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,190
No, the original,
the five-hour long version

682
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,593
that's all in Russian,
where a bunch of people die.

683
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,195
It's-it's awful.

684
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,029
- Why don't you just not go?
- Oh, God, no.

685
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:48,931
No, she would never let me
live it down.

686
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,700
It's much easier
to do it this way.

687
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:54,071
Guys, are we not taking
Christmas back this year?

688
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,738
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

689
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,573
I'm asking you that seriously
'cause I got so wasted

690
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,476
at the mall, I can't remember
if I actually said that

691
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,445
or if that's just something that
I'm dreaming about right now.

692
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,247
Oh, shit. I'm so late for work.

693
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:08,217
You guys, do you wanna know
what I've been working on?

694
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,656
- Happy Holidays.
- Oh, my...

695
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:17,093
- Carla!
- Broke my cock!

696
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,763
- Just go to work.
- I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!

697
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:34,611
- What up, lady?
- Mom! What are you doing here?

698
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,345
What does it look like
I'm doing?

699
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:40,117
I'm waiting for my daughter
to give me a free manicure.

700
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,186
- Free manicure, huh?
- Yeah.

701
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,189
Alright. Well, at least
I'm not waxing your pussy.

702
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,592
- Maybe next time.
- Okay.

703
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:52,461
So, what's up?
You seein' anybody?

704
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:54,363
Well, you know,
there was a couple of things

705
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,132
going with some dads
from school.

706
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,834
But it gets complicated.

707
00:28:58,836 --> 00:29:01,772
Plus, like, there is not
a better time of the year

708
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,340
to be single than Christmas.

709
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,208
I mean, it's like,
I go to the mall

710
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,378
and I see these, you know,
these couples walking around.

711
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,314
And they're, they're, like,
holding hands and...

712
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:14,884
You know,
wearing scarves

713
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,521
and feeding
each other sandwiches

714
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:22,124
and lookin' at jewelry,
you know...

715
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:24,561
<i>♪ Every kiss
begins with Kay ♪♪</i>

716
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,630
- Alright, stop. Stop.
- What?

717
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:29,800
- You sound super lonely.
- No!

718
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:32,069
Babe, listen,
the rock and roll lifestyle

719
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,469
isn't for everybody.

720
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,471
I'm still super rock and roll.

721
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,673
I woke up in a park
this morning.

722
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:42,044
Carla. I found kale chips
in your kitchen.

723
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,881
- Okay, those are for my kid.
- Right.

724
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,251
They're healthy as fuck.

725
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,885
Th... They say
they're heart-smart.

726
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:52,221
You really care about
your kid, don't you?

727
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,490
Yeah, he's my...

728
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,493
I mean, most... people

729
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,094
care about their children, mom.

730
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,229
Whatever, I just can't keep up

731
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,402
with the latest
parenting trends.

732
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,872
So, how you doin'?

733
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,441
I've been better actually,
to tell you the truth. I...

734
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,245
There is something
that I'm very excited about

735
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,947
which I just need
a little money for...

736
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,715
Here we go.

737
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:20,917
- What?
- You always do this.

738
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,718
What?

739
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,353
You show back up in my life.

740
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,256
You ask me for money,
I give it to you.

741
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:29,191
You gamble it all away
and you leave me and then

742
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:31,393
you just come runnin' back
asking for more.

743
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:33,529
I give it to you again
'cause I'm an idiot.

744
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,231
This is a legitimate

745
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,967
business opportunity.

746
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,401
How much do you need?

747
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,571
Not much. Like five grand.

748
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,474
Really. Fiv... Between five
and ten grand, maybe 15, tops.

749
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,277
Okay, I'll think about it.

750
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,548
Good!

751
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:55,418
Wow, you have some
really cool shit here, huh?

752
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,554
Nice, classy place.

753
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,460
<i>I wish I'd brought my purse.</i>

754
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:12,803
Why do we have to go to
the "Russian Nutcracker" again?

755
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:13,969
I mean, we're not even Russian.

756
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:15,237
The "Russian Nutcracker"

757
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:17,474
is the <i>real</i> "Nutcracker."

758
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,979
Not the sellout Disney version
with all the dancing and joy.

759
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,648
Is it actually five hours long?

760
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,150
Yes, and you will love
every minute of it.

761
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,319
Now, just listen
to this beautiful music.

762
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:36,458
This song is called
"When Boris Gets Murdered."

763
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,794
It sounds like
someone's yelling at us.

764
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,697
Why can't we just
go do something fun?

765
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:48,505
Where are you going?
It's not left.

766
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,006
- The theater's to the right.
- Oh, I know.

767
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,373
We're not goin' to the theater.

768
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,508
Where are you taking us?

769
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,779
You'll see.

770
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,166
Merry Christmas, guys!
Welcome to Sky Zone!

771
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,367
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

772
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,134
- Alright, uh, three kid passes?
- Yes.

773
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:21,705
No, no. Uh, sorry. We're-we're
actually all gonna go.

774
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:23,907
- We're all gonna do it.
- No, we're not all doing it.

775
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,875
It smells like diapers in here.

776
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,812
- Amy! You guys made it!
- Hey!

777
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:31,247
- I'm so glad you guys came!
- Oh, my God. Me, too.

778
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,016
I think my mother's gonna kill
me in the middle of the night.

779
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:35,986
- But it's totally worth it.
- Hi, I'm Carla's mom.

780
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,387
- Hi. Isis!
- Yeah.

781
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,022
- Oh, yeah! Yeah!
- Nice to meet you.

782
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:43,192
Hi. You must be Amy's mom.
I'm Carla.

783
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,094
Jaxon, honey,
mama needs more hooch.

784
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,862
- Ooh, good idea.
- Yeah.

785
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,032
- Top me off, babe.
- That's my son, Jaxon.

786
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,935
- This is my mom, Isis.
- Hello. Ruth.

787
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:55,671
- Like Ruth Bader Ginsberg.
- Huh. Isis.

788
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,708
Like the terrorist organization.

789
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,544
- This is my mom, Sandy.
- Oh, hi, Amy.

790
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:05,282
I've heard so much about you.

791
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:09,252
Oh, boy! You really have
the same haircuts.

792
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:12,554
Hello, I'm Ruth.
I'm Amy's mom.

793
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:15,361

Hi, Ruth.
We bought you a churro.

827
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,773
- You want that?
- No, thank you.

828
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,209
This place is fun.

829
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,177
I never went to a place like
this when I was a kid.

830
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,644
My God, no.

831
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:44,146
When I was a kid,
we would go down

832
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,316
to the quarry
and blow shit up.

833
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,784
That's nice.
Where are you ladies from?

834
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,021
I am from Ottawa,
which is in Canada.

835
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,222
And then my husband Dirk
wanted a faster life

836
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,791
so we moved to Bismarck,
North Dakota.

837
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:59,294
And then I had Kiki
when I was only 18 years old.

838
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:02,664
And then Dirk died.
A long, slow, painful death.

839
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:06,168
But we're all gonna die
sometime, alone and afraid.

840
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,037
- Where are you from, Ruth?
- Chicago.

841
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,872
The City of Lights!

842
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,173
The Windy City.

843
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,242
You know what they call
Bismarck?

844
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,809
"The City of Old White People."

845
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,677
You are so weird.

846
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,048
Ruth, did you enjoy
growing up in Chicago?

847
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,483
No. My mother
was a terrible woman.

848
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,385
- Oh.
- She once slapped me.

849
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,921
For wearing open-toed shoes
on a sailboat.

850
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,523
Well, it was
a different time then.

851
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,525
This was two months ago.

852
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,360
My daughter thinks
that I'm so hard on her.

853
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,996
But she has no idea
what I went through

854
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,497
with my own mother.

855
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,865
When I was 15,
I got my ears pierced

856
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,901
and she called me a whore.

857
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,070
And sent me away
to boarding school.

858
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,938
- In Croatia.
- Croatia?

859
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,606
- Now, that is a hard woman.
- Uh.

860
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:46,543
- Where are you from, Isis?
- I don't know, everywhere.

861
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,010
I never met my parents.

862
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,845
I basically just raised myself

863
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,447
using my wits and my tits.

864
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,916
Oh, wow.
That sounds disgusting.

865
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,718
No, dude, I was a roadie
for REO Speedwagon

866
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,055
for 15 years.

867
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:02,525
Oh, um, Isis, you're not allowed
to smoke cigarettes in here.

868
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,860
It's okay.
It's not a cigarette.

869
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,294
- You want some?
- No! Ahem!

870
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,896
- You want some?
- Uh, no, thank you.

871
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,766
- Suit yourself.
- So...

872
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,235
Which church does everyone
go to on Christmas Eve?

873
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,269
Well, I always go
to midnight mass

874
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:16,072
at Our Mother
of Perpetual Suffering.

875
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:18,240
It's the premiere service
in the city.

876
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,110
- Great, I'll meet you there.
- What?

877
00:36:20,112 --> 00:36:22,979
This is so nice.
Making new friends.

878
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,048
- Yeah.
- You guys wanna play dodgeball?

879
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,816
No, honey.
Grandmas don't play dodgeball.

880
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:28,550
- We should...
- What the fuck did she say?

881
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:30,820
She said, "Grandmas
don't play dodgeball."

882
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,055
I got it, but we play.
We play.

883
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,124
I'm in.

Do you think
that was funny, Hank?

898
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,044

- Would that be funny, too?
- Oh, Jesus, babe.

900
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:41,450
I can't believe
A-Amy is actually intent

901
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,918
on ruining Christmas this year.

902
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,454
I'm gonna have
to redouble my efforts.

903
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:45,887
Or you could stop
fighting with her

904
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,624
and we could just have
a nice Christmas.

905
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:50,193
Do you think I enjoy fighting
with my daughter, Hank?

906
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:53,595
- Yeah! Oh.
- Because I don't.

907
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,530
I'm just trying to give
my grandchildren

908
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:58,867
the amazing Christmas
that they deserve.

909
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,204
This is their first Christmas
without their father.

910
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,704
And if it is perfect

911
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:05,608
they will know
that things are gonna be okay.

912
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,577
But if our daughter throws
a half-assed Christmas

913
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,880
it will rattle the kids,
and they could descend

914
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:14,083
into a spiral of fear,
depression and drugs.

915
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:18,488
Okay. But the kids looked
really happy tonight.

916
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,789
They would have been happier

917
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,557
at the "Russian Nutcracker,"
Hank.

918
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:25,327
My way of doing Christmas
is enchanting and magical.

919
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:29,064
And Amy's way of doing Christmas
is lazy and embarrassing.

920
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,900
And my way is better,
and my way will win.

921
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,568
Because my way will always win.

922
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,936
Well, I'm just glad
this is all about the kids.

923
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:37,106
Hank, I am Amy's mother

924
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,807
and it is my <i>job</i>

925
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,345
to push her to be the best
mother she possibly can be.

926
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,247
Trust me, someday
she will thank me

927
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:47,249
in an inspirational speech
at some large public venue.

928
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,653
Now, are you done
ironing my pajamas, Hank?

929
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,854
Yes, Ruth.

930
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:54,860
They're still warm.

931
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,996
I'm sorry you're upset.

932
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,798
Thank you.

933
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,702
It's okay.

934
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,342
You're wrinkling my pajamas.

935
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,309
I'll get your toothbrush ready.

936
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,479
Thank you.

937
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,617
Oh, my God. No more pussies.
Please, God. No more pussies.

938
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:25,220
Uh, yeah?

939
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,988
Oh, hi. Uh...

940
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,057
<i>Are you Carla?</i>

941
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,496
Yeah, I am.

942
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:36,231

- <i>I'm Ty Swindel.</i>

943
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,733

00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,235
<i>That's great news.</i>

945
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:42,238
Why don't you hop
on my table, Ty Swindel?

946
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Alright, thank you.

947
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,142
Okay.

948
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:49,311
So, uh, have you ever had
your balls waxed before, Ty?

949
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,414
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm, uh, I'm an exotic dancer.

950
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,483
So I have to keep my dick, balls
and taint smooth at all times.

951
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,851
- Great. Okay, got it.
- Yeah.

952
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,653
Um, so I am just gonna
remove the towel

953
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:01,057
and then we'll apply
the wax if you...

954
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,425
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

955
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,093
Look at the size of that thing.

956
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,996
This... It looks like
a parking cone.

957
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,097
I am so sorry.
I forgot to te...

958
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,599
You know,
it scares most people.

959
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,034
No, I'm not scared, though.
I just...

960
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,436
I'm gonna need a lot more...

961
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:16,037
- Just a lot more wax.
- Okay.

962
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,942
- So just give me one second.
- Sure.

963
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,347
Wow. Okay.

964
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,447
So, who usually
waxes your balls?

965
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,517
Oh, I go to a woman
in, uh, Cleveland.

966
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,718
- Which is where I'm from.
- No way.

967
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,521
- What?
- I'm from Edgewater.

968
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,188
- You're from Edgewater?
- Yeah.

969
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,191
- I'm from Tremont!
- Oh, my God. Small world.

970
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:37,126
- Unbelievable.
- That is so weird!

971
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,262
Like... Right?

972
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:41,731
Wow. Okay, um...

973
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,133
If you could just, uh,
lift that penis up for me.

974
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:45,534
Okay.

975
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,936
Yeah, that's great.

976
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,104
So, uh, what brings you
to Chicago, Ty?

977
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,974
Well, I'm in town to do
a few Sexy Santa competitions.

978
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,409
- Nice!
- Yeah.

979
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,581
Okay, slight sting
on your nutsack.

980
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,722
So, um, how did you
get into dancing?

981
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,791
Oh, I'm a fireman by trade.
That's what I do.

982
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:10,927
Of course you are.

983
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,160
And a few years ago

984
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,396
I responded to this fire
at a strip club.

985
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,599
And the owner comes up to me,
and he's like

986
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:19,468
"Hey, dude.
You got a massive cock?"

987
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,271
And I'm like,
"Uh... Well, I do."

988
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:25,073
And the rest is,
the rest is history.

989
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,476
Wow.

990
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:28,677
That's a beautiful story, Ty.

991
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,113
Thank you.

992
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,450
Okay. Hot burn.

993
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,919
- So, um, holidays, huh?
- I know.

994
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:39,856
You got big plans
with your girlfriend?

995
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:42,291
I wish. I wish
I had a girlfriend.

996
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,994
Yeah, most women,
they just see me as this object

997
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:47,863
to have sex with
and then they leave. You know?

998
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,164
And I'm like,
"Yeah, I dance around

999
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,367
"in basketball sneakers
and a G-string.

1000
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,702
It doesn't mean
I don't have feelings." Right?

1001
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,304
Yeah.

1002
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,872
I, uh...

1003
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,374
I can relate.

1004
00:42:58,376 --> 00:42:59,775
I don't know what it is
about you, I just...

1005
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,142
I feel like you're easy
to talk to, you know?

1006
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:05,113
I can just open up.
Be myself. It's nice.

1007
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,652
I feel the same way, Ty.

1008
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,988
Okay, um,
I'm gonna need you

1009
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,356
to, uh, put your heels
over your head

1010
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,626
so I can start to go to town
on your taint and your butthole.

1011
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,227
- Yep.
- Great. Thanks.

1012
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,463
- Alright.
- Okay.

1013
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:21,863
Let's get these
out of the way.

1014
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,633
Right. There we go.
Great, great, great.

1015
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:25,700
Carla, uh...

1016
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:28,403
At the risk of sounding forward

1017
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:31,240
um, would you be willing
to come with me

1018
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:33,876
to my Sexy Santa
Competition tonight?

1019
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:36,345
Uh, well, I-I don't date
my clients, Ty.

1020
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,813
I have a really strict code.

1021
00:43:38,815 --> 00:43:41,150
Yeah. Oh, of course you do.
Are you kidding me?

1022
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,084
I know. And I know. And-and you
should. You should have a...

1023
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:46,255
I'm just fuckin' with you, Ty.
I don't have a code!

1024
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:48,758
I'm waxing your butthole.

1025
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,492
I would love to go to your show.

1026
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,160
- You would?
- Yes!

1027
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,429
<i>Yes! Oh, my God.</i>

1028
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:55,197
She's funny and she's beautiful.

1029
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,532
This is a combination you don't
run into every day, you know.

1030
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,669
Well, you don't see this combo
that often, either.

1031
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,905
So it's a date, then.
I'll see you tonight.

1032
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,740
It's a date.

1033
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:08,209
Oh, um, do you want me
to reach down there

1034
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:11,012
and-and I can pull my butt crack
open for you if you want.

1035
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:13,215
Thank you.

1036
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,851
No one's ever asked
if they could hold

1037
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:19,121
their butt crack
open for me before.

1038
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,793
I'll hold my butt crack open
for you anytime you want, Carla.

1039
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:26,565
Where did you come from,
Ty Swindel?

1040
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,206
So what brings you
here today, Kiki?

1041
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,744
Well, um, my mom and I,
we're very close.

1042
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,945
And we would like to be...

1043
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:44,981
To be closer.

1044
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:46,983
No. No.

1045
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:49,985
I think, uh, we would,
we would like to be

1046
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,753
a little more independent.

1047
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,122
Closer.

1048
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:55,391
Uh, Sandy, tell me

1049
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:57,226
about your relationship
with your daughter.

1050
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,563
Oh, my gosh.
That's my favorite topic.

1051
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:04,733
Well, I had Kiki
when I was 18 years old.

1052
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:07,135
And when the nurse
placed her on my breast

1053
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,570
I looked down at her
and I said

1054
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:12,173
"You are gonna be
my best friend forever."

1055
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:14,843
Is that normal?
The best friend forever thing?

1056
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,612
Uh, well, you know,
we don't like to use the word

1057
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,516
"Normal" around here.

1058
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:24,186
Anyways, Kiki and I have
always been super close

1059
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:26,421
because we're basically
the same age.

1060
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,289
And then my husband died

1061
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:31,827
and we became crazy close.

1062
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,329
We went to prom together.

1063
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,530
Wow!

1064
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,766
Okay.

1065
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:39,601
And, uh, Kiki, uh...

1066
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,804
How does all this closeness
make you feel?

1067
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:43,305
- Well...
- Well, she feels great.

1068
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,840
Who wouldn't want to be
best friends with their mom?

1069
00:45:45,842 --> 00:45:47,677
- I love my mom.
- Thank you, honey.

1070
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,311
- I really do.
- Thank you.

1071
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,713
But sometimes,
she can be a bit much.

1072
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,215
What?

1073
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:56,351
- Like when?
- Like, uh...

1074
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,653
When you watched Kent and I
have sex the other night.

1075
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,289
Oh, Lord.

1076
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,856
I just wanna know
what's going on in your life.

1077
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:03,659
- Is that so wrong?
- No.

1078
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:05,327
But sometimes, I just...

1079
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,231
I'm in need of a little space.

1080
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,666
Oh, boy. I don't know
what's happening right now.

1081
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:15,805
- W-why are you turning on me?
- I'm not turning on you.

1082
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,240
I'm just saying,
I think that we could benefit

1083
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,142
from some boundaries, right?

1084
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,179
I have cancer.

1085
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:25,213
- Cancer?
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

1086
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,918
Oh, God. What kind of cancer?

1087
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,923
Heart... cancer.

1088
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,059
- Heart cancer?
- Yeah.

1089
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,329
Stage 12.

1090
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:42,731
Maybe you can find it
in your non-cancerous heart

1091
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,869
to be nice to me before I die.

1092
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:50,238
I'm so sorry, mom.
I had... I had no idea.

1093
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,508
I know. I know.

1094
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,880
Oh, God.

1095
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:59,447
<i>Mom.</i>

1096
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,217
Oh, Keeks.

1097
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:04,285
Oh, Kiki. No, no. Keeks.

1098
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:06,722
- Okay, I don't have cancer.
- What?

1099
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:07,756
I knew it.

1100
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,758
But imagine if I did have cancer

1101
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,360
how would you feel
being so mean to your mother?

1102
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,262
I'm not trying
to be mean to you, mom.

1103
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,898
I'm trying to have
an honest conversation

1104
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,066
about our relationship.

1105
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:18,467
- I have cancer again.
- No.

1106
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:19,934
It doesn't work like that
a second time.

1107
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:22,271
- I have polio.
- I think they cured polio.

1108
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:24,439
- I have bubonic plague.
- No.

1109
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,775
- I have shingles.
- Mom!

1110
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:27,142
I have bird flu.

1111
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,278
- Are you done?
- I have a lazy eye.

1112
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,713
Mom!

1113
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:33,282
Please, can we just talk
about our relationship?

1114
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,251
Because I wanna work
this out with you.

1115
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:36,952
Yes.

1116
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,655
Let's do that. Yes.

1117
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:41,222
- Really?
- Yes.

1118
00:47:41,224 --> 00:47:42,258
I wanna work this out with you.

1119
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,392
Honestly?

1120
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:44,626
I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room

1121
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,394
and I will be right back.

1122
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,465
Okay.

1123
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:03,612
She's not coming back, is she?

1124
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,481
No.

1125
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:07,448
What is the matter with her?

1126
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,586
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

1127
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:13,755
Your mom was probably pretty
normal before she had you.

1128
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,191
But then you were born.

1129
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:16,825
And you didn't sleep
for six months

1130
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,693
so she didn't sleep
for six months.

1131
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:21,597
And you refused to eat,
and when you did eat

1132
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,298
you would barf
all over her clothes.

1133
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,434
<i>And that made your mom
a little crazy.</i>

1134
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,936
And then you fell off your bike
and you broke your arm.

1135
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,537
And then you got bullied
in school.

1136
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,372
And then you started dating
that weird dude

1137
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:33,142
with the stick through his nose.

1138
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,943
And all those things
made your mom

1139
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,612
<i>a little more crazy.</i>

1140
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,046
And then you got married.

1141
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,849
And you bought a house
you can't afford.

1142
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:41,650
And you're raising kids
who never say

1143
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,184
"Please" or "Thank you."

1144
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,019
Shit, they can't even read.

1145
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:46,988
And all those things
made your mom

1146
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,523
super-duper crazy.

1147
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:50,825
And now you come
into my office, and you go

1148
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,963
"Dr. Karl,
why is my mom so crazy?"

1149
00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:56,731
And the answer is...

1150
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,999
you, motherfucker.

1151
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,834
You made your mom crazy.

1152
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,037
So be nice to your mom,
'cause you're the one

1153
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,972
who fucked her shit up.

What are you wearing?

1157
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:15,550
Sweetie, if you wanna win
the Caroling Cup

1158
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,253
you have to have a theme.

1159
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:18,921
Which is why we are all going

1160
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:21,523
as characters
from "A Christmas Carol."

Jane, you are the Ghost

Oh, great.

00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:32,700
Oh. Wow, thanks, mom.

1166
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:34,535
I just think it's appropriate,
given how much

1167
00:49:34,537 --> 00:49:36,604
you seem to hate
Christmas this year.

1168
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,573
Mother, I don't hate Christmas.

1169
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,441
And here is
everyone's sheet music.

1170
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:42,443
I'd hoped we'd all be
off-book by now.

1171
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:44,280
- This is a lot of songs.
- Well...

1172
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,615
Every home in Westbury gets to
vote on who wins the Cup.

1173
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:50,084
So we have to hit at least
300 houses tonight.

1174
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:51,352
Three hundred?

1175
00:49:51,354 --> 00:49:52,854
Don't worry. We have back-up.

00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,365
I did what I needed to do
to succeed, Amy.

1180
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,133
You should try it sometime.

Okay, fine.
We'll go caroling.

this ridiculous costume.

Don't laugh, she's my friend.
That's rude.

- Okay, um.

1220
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,086
Can you do a li... Can you purse
your lips for me a little bit?

I'll put a filter on it,

I will never let you
forget this.

- You know that.
- I do.

Was that a broken dick
on her face?

Well, I thought that was
an enormous success.

00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,907
Mom, this, this,
this isn't working.

00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,675
- What isn't working?
- This, this.

1230
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,410
I-I wanted a mellow Christmas

1231
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,380
and you keep fighting me
every step of the way.

1232
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:34,182
Amy, this is a very important
Christmas for your kids.

1233
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,883
You cannot just phone it in.

1234
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:38,186
I'm not,
I'm not phoning it in.

1235
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:41,255
My kids told me that
they wanted a mellow Christmas.

1236
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:43,425
And I promised them
that I would give it to them.

1237
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:45,193
Well, of course
they told you that, Amy.

1238
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,595
Because they're telling you what
they think you want to hear.

1239
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:48,963
But secretly,
they know that I'm right.

1240
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,400
Because you know what?
I just am.

1241
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:53,034
Okay.

1242
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,472
Ha-ha! You know what?
I'm done fighting this.

1243
00:52:56,474 --> 00:52:58,407
I'm gonna tell you exactly

1244
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,441
how we're doing Christmas
this year.

1245
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,276
The kids and I
are gonna spend

1246
00:53:02,278 --> 00:53:03,979
the entire Christmas Eve day
sledding.

1247
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:05,414
And then,
we're gonna come home

1248
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,883
bake cookies,
and watch "Love Actually."

1249
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:10,385
- Dumb movie.
- Then, Christmas morning.

1250
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,753
Only Jessie and his daughter
are gonna come over

1251
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:15,157
and we're gonna exchange
three gifts.

1252
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,892
Who's Jessie?

1253
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,593
Then we're gonna spend
all day in our pajamas

1254
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,762
until my friends
come over for dinner

1255
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,898
when we are gonna order
Chinese takeout from Mr. Wang's.

1256
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,501
- The horror.
- Ugh!

1257
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:27,468
There'll be
no show-offy party

1258
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,972
no sushi, no camels.

1259
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:34,843
And definitely, definitely,
no Kenny G.

1260
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:37,146
Amy, he is the godfather
of smooth jazz.

1261
00:53:37,148 --> 00:53:40,314
Mom, I am done with
your over-the-top Christmases.

1262
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:42,151
This is my house,
and this is my life.

1263
00:53:42,153 --> 00:53:43,619
And if you want
to come down here

1264
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:45,921
and be a part
of my family

1265
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:48,026
then you have to live
by my rules.

1266
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:53,929
- Okay.
- Really?

1267
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,099
<i>We will do it your way.</i>

1268
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:59,336
We will have
a <i>mellow</i> Christmas.

1269
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:03,271
I hope you're happy.

1270
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,372
I don't think you mean that.

1271
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,307
But thank you, I am.

1272
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:11,313

00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,030
And it worked.

1277
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:29,697
I stood up to her,
and she totally backed down.

1278
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,200
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

1279
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,367
I actually felt,
for the first time

1280
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:35,137
my mom looked at me
as an equal.

1281
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:39,474
Like maybe someday,
somehow, we could be closer.

1282
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,842
Relax, Obama.

1283
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,077
Your mom is still
a colossal bitch.

1284
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,813
Don't let your guard down,
or she's gonna blow up your car.

1285
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,481
- Alright, alright.
- <i>I'm just saying.</i>

1286
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:49,651
Well, either way,
it was a big step.

1287
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:52,887
So, I just wanna say thank you
for encouraging me.

1288
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:56,592
- Aww, we're so proud. Whoo!
- Thank you.

1289
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,760
You know what I think
we should do to celebrate?

1290
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,862
Watch a bunch of Santa Clauses

1291
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:04,233
take off their clothes!

00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,447
Oh, yay!
I love Santa Claus.

1299
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,017
<i>And there's so many of them.</i>

1300
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,119
Guys, I don't wanna make
a big deal of it.

1301
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,722
But, um, I'm kind of
on a first date

1302
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:28,956
with one of the Santas.

1303
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,392
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1304
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:32,727
Wait. Which one?

1305
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,731
Santa number two.

1306
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:38,032
<i>♪ If you know what I mean

1307

1308
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,202
How'd you guys meet?

1309
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,604
Oh, waxing his balls.

1310
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:44,606
That is so romantic.

1311
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:47,409
You learn a lot about a man
when you wax his sack.

1312
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:50,646
You know, some guys cry.
Some guys act real tough.

1313
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:55,249
But... But Ty, he was so calm.

1314
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:59,086
It was almost like waxing
the balls of the Dalai Lama.

1315
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:00,123
Whoo!

1316
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,624
How you doin' tonight, Chicago?

1317
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,093
<i>Alright.</i>

1318
00:56:06,095 --> 00:56:07,262
Okay, listen, ladies

1319
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:09,063
I need you guys to tell me

1320
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,766
which one of these Sexy Santas

1321
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:13,302
<i>is the sexiest of them all?</i>

1322
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:15,604
<i>Think you're ready? Yeah!</i>

1323
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,171
<i>Okay, well,
let's start this thing off.</i>

1324
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,407
Santa number one,
the bar is yours, sir.

1325
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,158
Oh. That is a lot of white skin.

1326
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:43,331
<i>Okay, you know what? Alright,
alright, Santa number one.</i>

1327
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,865
The audience has spoken.

1328
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:46,334
Thank you. Such a good sport.

1329
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,035
Such a good sport.

1330
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:50,706
Alright. Now.

1331
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,307
Bring it to the stage,
my man

1332
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:56,043
Santa number two!

1333
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:21,005
Yeah! Take it off!

1334
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,354
He's, he's really good
at stripping.

1335
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:43,224
- He has such kind eyes.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1336
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,162
I'm gonna fuck
his dick off tonight.

1337
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:52,036
Put a baby in me,
Santa number two!

1338
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:54,372
Whoo!

1339
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:58,776
Whoo! I love his panties.
They're so seasonal.

1340
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:09,052
Oh, my God.

1341
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:16,023
- I think I'm in love.
- What?

1342
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:20,197
I honestly think
that he's... the one.

1343
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:22,566
Is that your mom?

1344
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,137
Wait, holy shit. It is.
Why is... Mom!

1345
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,441
<i>What, what are you doing?</i>

1346
00:58:32,443 --> 00:58:34,041
- Oh, look at that.
- Yeah.

1347
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,146
My mom dances this way
with everybody.

1348
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:40,784
So, this doesn't bother me
at all.

1349
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,454
Oh, my God.
His face is in her tits.

1350
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:47,889
Wait. Mom.
Mom, no motorboating!

1351
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,458
- We talked about this.
- Alright.

1352
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,059
- It's about to get weird.
- It's game time.

1353
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:52,827
- Oh, you look great!
- That's my mom.

1354
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,262
- That's your mom?
- Yeah, that's my mom.

1355
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,063
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

1356
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,499
Oh, my God, it's a pleasure.
You have such a lovely daughter.

1357
00:58:58,501 --> 00:58:59,601
I know.

1358
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:05,139
You should never have to watch

1359
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,476
your mom lick
your boyfriend's nipples.

1360
00:59:07,478 --> 00:59:09,510
- No.
- Mom!

1361
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,912
What are you doing?

1362
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:13,948
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

1363
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,017
Mom!

1364
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:23,791
Not one person caught me.
That was amazing.

1365
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,695
Every time they jump into
the crowd, someone usually...

1366
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:28,329
- Hi.
- Oh.

1367
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,365
- Hi. Hey.
- Here you are.

1368
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:33,501
I, uh... Bag of ice for you.

1369
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,440
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Thank you, Ty.

1370
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,039
Um...

1371
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:40,175
So, about tonight, um, you know

1372
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,110
we were gonna hang out
after the show.

1373
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:43,945
And, uh, I mean,
I was looking forward to it.

1374
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,680
I was wondering if, uh...

1375
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,048
If you're still up for it,
you know?

1376
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,316
- Oh, Ty.
- Yeah.

1377
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:50,318
Um...

1378
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,122
- I would love to.
- Good.

1379
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:55,155
But, um...

1380
00:59:55,157 --> 00:59:56,691
You know, I think this is

1381
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,693
my mom's third concussion
this month and I'm just...

1382
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,496
Wow, that's
a lot of concussions.

1383
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:04,331
Better stay with her
for observation.

1384
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,333
Yeah.

1385
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,239
Well, um...

1386
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,972
I gotta get back
to Cleveland tomorrow.

1387
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:14,843
- Right.
- But, uh...

1388
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:16,845
Think I could give you a call
next time I come into town?

1389
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:19,146
Would that...
that interest you at all?

1390
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,215
Could I do that?

1391
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,249
- Please.
- Yeah?

1392
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:22,684
- Yes.
- Great.

1393
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:25,519
I'd, I'd wax your balls
for free.

1394
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,055
That is so sweet.

1395
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,427
Well, I would really
love that, Carla.

1396
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:33,929
And so would my balls.

1397
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:36,831
Well. Consider it done.

1398
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:37,835
And, uh...

1399
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,235
Oh.

1400
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,940
Sorry, I thought
you wanted to...

1401
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,342
Merry Christmas, Carla.

1402
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,679

1412
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:30,619
Okay, time for bed,
my darlings.

1413
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:32,787
Tonight, I am
going to sing you

1414
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,655
"My Heart Will Go On"

1415
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,425
by seven-time Grammy winner,
Celine Dion.

1416
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:39,429
Mm-hm?

1417
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:43,501
What's the matter?

1418
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,434
Is everything okay
with you and mom?

1419
01:01:47,436 --> 01:01:49,604
Yeah, you guys
have been fighting a lot.

1420
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:52,143
Come here and sit by me.
Both of you, come here.

1421
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:58,579
Now, your mother and I just
have a few tiny disagreements

1422
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:00,115
about the importance
of Christmas

1423
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:01,782
and what it means to be a mother

1424
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,284
and the sanctity of marriage
and how best to raise children.

1425
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:06,621
But otherwise,
everything is fine.

1426
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:10,525
There's no reason
to worry, okay?

1427
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:13,628
Look, I know
this is your first Christmas

1428
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,497
since your parents got divorced.

1429
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:17,865
And it's probably a little
strange for you. Am I right?

1430
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,501
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It really is.

1431
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:21,369
Well, first of all

1432
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:24,805
both of your parents
still love you so very much.

1433
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:27,541
And no matter what happens

1434
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,811
I will always be there for you.

1435
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,546
Always.

1436
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,450
Because you're my grandkids,
and I love you

1437
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:37,818
more than anything
in the whole world.

1438
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,954
And so does Grandpa Hank.

1439
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:41,655
I know his brain
is the size of a walnut

1440
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,560
but you know,
his heart is enormous.

1441
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,731
- Okay? Feel better?
- Yeah.

1442
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:51,566
It's really nice
having you here, grandma.

1443
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:54,235
- Yeah. We really miss you.
- Yeah.

1444
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:57,505
Oh, I miss you, too.

1445
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:01,209
Grandkids, they really are
the greatest gift.

1446
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:04,912
Speaking of gifts,
have some iPhones.

1447
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,715
- Nice.
- No way.

1448
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:08,650
Now, get ready for bed.

1449
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:11,921
And I will come back
and sing to you for hours.

1450
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:20,260
I can't believe people fall
for this shit. It's so stupid.

1451
01:03:20,262 --> 01:03:22,162
<i>- Yeah, I know.
- Oh wait, here comes somebody.</i>

1452
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:24,032
- Merry Christmas!
- Oh, Merry Christmas.

1453
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:25,166
Ho, ho, hold on.

1454
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,867
Hey, would you like to,
uh, donate

1455
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:30,271
your canned goods to our
Christmas Canned Food Drive?

1456
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,773
Oh, um, I sort of just
bought all this.

1457
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:36,244
- Bingo. She's got cans.
- Oh!

1458
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:38,912
Oh, mom, look, look, look.
She's got wine.

1459
01:03:38,914 --> 01:03:41,249
Thank you very much
for a very generous donation

1460
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,084
to the "Canned Christmas
Food Drive."

1461
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:44,921
The children are
gonna be so happy.

1462
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,688
Yes!

1463
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,425
- That was a good haul, mom.
- Yeah, she had some good shit.

1464
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:53,227
You know...
ripping off rich people

1465
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,764
in front of the supermarket
with you is...

1466
01:03:55,766 --> 01:03:58,733
bringing back a lotta happy
Christmas memories for me.

1467
01:03:58,735 --> 01:04:01,436
Yeah. Me too, babe.

1468
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,604
I miss you, you know?

1469
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:05,305
I miss you, too.

1470
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:08,041
It's so weird.

1471
01:04:08,043 --> 01:04:12,215
Yeah. Maybe we should...
spend more time together?

1472
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,916
Do you mean that?

1473
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,385
Yeah.

1474
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:18,653
You know, when we were
at the bouncy place

1475
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:21,456
with, um... what's his name?

1476
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,758
- Oh, my son, Jaxon?
- Yeah, him.

1477
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,126
Um, I was watching you two
and you were beating the shit

1478
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,095
out of each other
with those sticks, and I thought

1479
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,798
"You know, maybe I should have a
relationship with my grandson."

1480
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,337
Well, we'd, um,
we'd love to see you more.

1481
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:38,005
Yeah. Okay.

1482
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,807
You know, uh...

1483
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,175
I've been doing
a lot of thinking

1484
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,144
about the money
you asked me for, mom, and...

1485
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:45,512
Um, I'm such an idiot.

1486
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:49,286
But it's Christmas
and you're my mom and...

1487
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:53,688
Eh, fuck it. Here.
It's a loan. It's a loan.

1488
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,289
I mean, this is not everything
you asked for, but...

1489
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,791
- Oh, no, that's great!
- Basically all I have.

1490
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,459
Thank you so much.
This is a loan.

1491
01:04:59,461 --> 01:05:01,195
I will pay you back, I swear.

1492
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,597
I really have
my shit together now.

1493
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:04,365
Thanks. Whoa!

1494
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,601
Hey! Sir, Merry Christmas!

1495
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:08,436
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

1496
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:11,872
Would you like to donate your
cans to our Canned Food Drive?

1497
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:14,843
We're collecting
for a drive for the homeless.

1498
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:17,878
- Yikes. I just bought all this.
- And the canned goods.

1499
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,947
- You know, this is important.
- The fuck is this?

1500
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,782
Uh, that's fennel.

1501
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:23,351
- Oh, fuck it.
- So happy.

1502
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:25,220
Thank you so much.

1503
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:28,956
Oh, shit. Manager. Manager's
coming. Code red, code red.

1504
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,325
Go, go, go. Mom!
Where did we park?

1505
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,059
- Where did we park?
- Happy Hanukkah.

1506
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,293
- Where did we park?
- <i>Go, go, go, go.</i>

1507
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:35,863
They just totally stole
all my shit.

1508
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,365
Taking this, though.
This is cute, right?

1509
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:38,499
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1510
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,133
<i>Okay, guys.</i>

1511
01:05:40,135 --> 01:05:42,003
So since it's Christmas Eve,
everybody gets to open

1512
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:43,503
one present, okay?

1513
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:46,206
Oh! Kiki. Hey, Kiki, Kiki.
Open mine.

1514
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,209
Please open mine first.
Please.

1515
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:51,015
- I'll go first. I guess.
- Okay.

1516
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:54,514
What's this?

1517
01:05:54,516 --> 01:05:57,251
It is a key

1518
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:00,054
to my new house!

1519
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,923
What are you talking about?

1520
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:03,724
Well, after our therapy session

1521
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,193
I felt like
we were drifting apart.

1522
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:08,829
So I decided to move
closer to you guys.

1523
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:11,865
Oh. Okay. Uh,
where are you moving to?

1524
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,434
Right next door!

1525
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,070
- Jesus.
- What?

1526
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,039
You're moving, um,
next door to me?

1527
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,874
Yeah, the house
wasn't on the market.

1528
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:22,110
So I checked it out on Zillow
and I made an all-cash offer.

1529
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:24,378
And then, boom.
Howdy, neighbor.

1530
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,081
- Howdy, neighbor.
- Oh, my God.

1531
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,450
We can dig a tunnel
between the houses. Keeks!

1532
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:32,222
Oh, Keeks.

1533
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,023
Kent, get the kids out of here.

1534
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:37,758
Mm-hm. Yep, yep. Let's go, guys.
Let's get outta here.

1535
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,293
Mommy and grandma gotta talk.
Come on, buddy.

1536
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,128
This is gonna get ugly.

1537
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,396
- Mom. Mom.
- What? What?

1538
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:43,965
You can't live next door to me.

1539
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:46,767
- Why, why not?
- Because I need space.

1540
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,139
And t-that,
that is too close.

1541
01:06:50,907 --> 01:06:54,474
- I have diabetes.
- Mom, stop.

1542
01:06:54,476 --> 01:06:56,077
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Kiki. Kiki.

1543
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,244
- Sit.
- Kiki.

1544
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:58,713
- I've got strep throat.
- Mom.

1545
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,148
- I might have gallstones...
- No.

1546
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,983
- And really, Kiki, this is...
- Enough.

1547
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:04,485
We need to have
this conversation.

1548
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,588
I am a grown woman
who needs a life

1549
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,990
that is separate from yours,
and I need you

1550
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,827
to have a life
that's separate from mine.

1551
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,762
I'm sorry.

1552
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,231
Kiki, I don't want a life
separate from yours.

1553
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:18,666
You're my favorite person
in the whole world.

1554
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:20,267
I know, but, mom,
this is starting

1555
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,601
to affect my marriage.

1556
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:23,271
- What?
- And my family.

1557
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:24,838
- Oh.
- And my sanity.

1558
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,175
And I just,
I need you to...

1559
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:30,280
To, to just let me go
a little bit.

1560
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:35,115
Well, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

1561
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,751
I don't know, mom! Anything!
Make some friends!

1562
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:39,519
You're always saying
you wanna go to Vegas

1563
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:41,956
to see Wayne Newton
before he dies.

1564
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,925
Do that! Anything!

1565
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:46,095
As long as it's without me!

1566
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:50,000
Without you?

1567
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,872
Why are you doing this
to me, Kiki?

1568
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:58,372
I didn't... Mom.

1569
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:01,878
And I really don't think
I can return that house!

1570
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:12,452
<i>- Whoo!
- Hey.</i>

1571
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:14,322
- How fun was that sledding?
- Oh, that was fun.

1572
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:16,691
There is still an alarming
amount of snow

1573
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:18,159
in my pants, I gotta say.

1574
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:19,626
Oh, I can't wait to go home

1575
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:22,030
throw on some jammies,
get comfy.

1576
01:08:22,032 --> 01:08:25,499
I know. It's gonna be... Oh,
look, someone's having a party.

1577
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,968
Yeah, they are.

1578
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:30,204
<i>- Wow, that's a lot of people.
- A lot of people.</i>

1579
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,738
<i>Wait.</i>

1580
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,476
You're having a party.

1581
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:36,479
Um, is that a camel?

1582
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,416
Yup, that's a camel.

1583
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,652
I'm gonna kill her.

1584
01:08:53,695 --> 01:08:55,599
What the fuck?

1585
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:03,771
What did she do to my house?

1586
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:05,841
No!

1587
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,078
<i>Gomenasai.</i>

1588
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:23,023

1589
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:29,800
Mom.

1590
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,970
You lied to me.

1591
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:36,269
I did what was best
for the family.

1592
01:09:36,271 --> 01:09:39,040
Mom, everything that is wrong
with Christmas is in this room

1593
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:40,407
and I want it all gone.

1594
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,143
Amy, don't be ridiculous.

1595
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,411
You can't kick Kenny G
out of the house.

1596
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:45,745
He's a national treasure.

1597
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:47,647
If you won't do it,
then I will.

1598
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:49,282
You wouldn't dare.

1599
01:09:49,284 --> 01:09:51,220
Oh. Watch me.

1600
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:57,458
Yo! I need you
to leave my house.

1601
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,625
What are you talking about?

1602
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,894
Get the fuck out, Kenny G.

1603
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:02,263
- I'm still getting paid, right?
- I don't know!

1604
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:04,732
Take your little flute and shoo!
Shoo, fly.

1605
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,834
- Go make another album.
- It's not a flute, bitch.

1606
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:09,504
Don't care. Thank you so much.
Thank you. You can go now.

1607
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:11,472
Please. You can leave.
Thank you so much for coming.

1608
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:12,906
Thank you very much.
You too, my friend.

<i>Please. No, no. Please exit.</i>

I don't know any of you.
Please leave my house.

1611
01:10:18,148 --> 01:10:20,982
Farewell, see you later.
Sushi chef, you gotta go.

1612
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:22,349
We're done.
You can take that plate.

1613
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:25,189
Amy, stop!
You're embarrassing the family.

1614
01:10:27,157 --> 01:10:29,423
Oh, my God. That's what
this is about, isn't it?

1615
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,958
This finally makes sense.

1616
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,126
The, the perfect decorations,
the perfect tree

1617
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,263
whatever the hell
that thing is in my front yard.

1618
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:38,198
You didn't do this for the kids!
You did this for you!

1619
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,866
All you care about
is for people to go

1620
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,701
"Oh, Ruth.
You're so amazing."

1621
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:43,437
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

Please don't leave

your Louis Vuitton swag bag.

Oh, God. Oh, God. Please.

1625
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:50,777
Th-this has got to all go.
A-all of this has got to go.

1626
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,046
Th-the swag bags,
th-the weird curtains

1627
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:54,648
the floor, the tree.

1628
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,218
Oh, God, the tree
has got to go.

1629
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,519
No, not my tree!
It's from Paris!

1630
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,789
- Watch me.
- No!

1631
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,323
No!

1632
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,192
Say goodbye to your tree,
mother!

1633
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:08,396
- That's an antique!
- It's a hideous tree, mother!

1634
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:10,830
- <i>You have no idea!</i>
- It's not even real snow!

1635
01:11:10,832 --> 01:11:12,799
How dare you! You know
how much that thing costs?

1636
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,669
I don't care! Let go!

1637
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:17,338
Let go! Let go!

1638
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,807
Those were from the "Titanic!"

1639
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:21,145
I don't care!

1640
01:11:24,247 --> 01:11:25,845
That ice was from the moon!

1641
01:11:25,847 --> 01:11:28,148
It was moon ice,
you nasty bitch!

1642
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,483
Let go of the stupid tree!

1643
01:11:30,485 --> 01:11:32,553
Let go!

1644
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:33,920
Listen, mom!

1645
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,322
I promised my kids

1646
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:36,924
I wouldn't do Christmas
like this!

1647
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:39,259
Everybody loves
a Christmas like this!

1648
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:40,928
It's fucking spectacular!

1649
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,699
No, they don't!

1650
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,444
Holy shit.

1651
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:59,112
- I need you to get out.
- Amy.

1652
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,447
I've been putting up
with your shit

1653
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,782
my entire life.

1654
01:12:02,784 --> 01:12:04,352
I can't do it anymore.

1655
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:06,519
I just... I can't.

1656
01:12:06,521 --> 01:12:07,921
I need you out of my house

1657
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:09,924
and I need you
out of my life for good.

1658
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:13,697
- You don't mean that.
- I really, really do.

1659
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,436
- Amy, it's Christmas.
- Mother, get out!

1660
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,896
Did you just kick out
grandma forever?

1661
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,162
Guys, how long
have you been standing here?

1662
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,997
How could you do this to us?

1663
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,334
Guys, would you please just
trust me that it's for the best?

1664
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:55,969
No, it's not!
It's the best for you.

1665
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:57,604
We actually love grandma.

1666
01:12:57,606 --> 01:13:00,340
Yeah, she's a part of our
family, and we love her.

1667
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,509
Yo-you don't just
kick someone out.

1668
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,646
First, you kick dad out.
Now, you kick grandma out.

1669
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:07,915
Who's next?
Are you gonna kick us out?

1670
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:11,085
What, honey, no, of course not.
I would never do that.

1671
01:13:11,087 --> 01:13:13,657
Why do you always have
to screw everything up?

1672

01:16:09,966 --> 01:16:11,868
Plus, all the bars are closed.

1719
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:17,370
Oh, you guys.

1720
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:20,710
I could really use some
churchin' tonight.

1721
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:24,478
You know what I mean?

1722
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,379
- No.
- Nope?

1723
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:30,384
Well, today my daughter told me
she needed "More space."

1724
01:16:30,386 --> 01:16:32,353
I don't even know
what that's supposed to mean.

1725
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:33,987
Yeah, well,
my daughter just kicked me

1726
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,388
out of her life forever.

1727
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,192
Why?

1728
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:39,893
Because I push her
to be the best

1729
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,995
and she can't handle it.

1730
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,731
Of course, my mother
pushed me twice as hard

1731
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:45,866
and I turned out amazing.

1732
01:16:45,868 --> 01:16:50,303
But I guess not everyone
is as incredibly strong as I am.

1733
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:53,307
Well, my daughter didn't kick me
out of the house or anything.

1734
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:55,476
But you would not believe
how mad she got

1735
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:57,510
when I told her I bought
the house next to hers.

1736
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:00,147
What? You bought the house
next to your daughter?

1737
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:03,017
- Yeah, I did.
- Did you ask her first?

1738
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:05,719
No, I wanted it
to be a surprise.

1739
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,854
Yeah, that might be a bit much.

1740
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:10,523
Dude, that is fucking psycho.

1741
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:12,192
Well, at least
I love my daughter.

1742
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:14,527
You only visit Carla
when you need money.

1743
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:15,662
Uh, no, that is not true.

1744
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:17,196
I visit her on other occasions

1745
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:20,067
like when I'm hiding
from someone.

1746
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:22,001
Oh, just admit it, Isis.

1747
01:17:22,003 --> 01:17:23,536
You're a degenerate gambler

1748
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:24,838
with a third-grade education

1749
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,005
and a cheap weave.

1750
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:28,342
This is my own hair, okay?

1751
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:29,876
And you're a terrible mother.

1752
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:33,013
- Ladies, it is Jesus' birthday.
- <i>No, I'm serious.</i>

1753
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:35,115
You think that
you are so perfect.

1754
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,684
But you are the worst mom
of all of us.

1755
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:39,519
- Well, I don't know...
- Okay, okay.

1756
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:41,522
Second worst, whatever.
But the point is

1757
01:17:41,524 --> 01:17:45,692
that you're one of those moms
that you, you dress so perfectly

1758
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:49,562
and you give fancy parties,
and you know how to cook food.

1759
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:51,732
And, and you have
all your own teeth.

1760
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:53,067
But you know what? You suck.

1761
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:55,736
You suck at all the shit
that really matters.

1762
01:17:55,738 --> 01:17:58,304
And I even can see it,
and I'm stoned all the time.

1763
01:17:58,306 --> 01:17:59,706
Please, you don't know
the first thing about me.

1764
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,040
Well, if you're
such an awesome mom

1765
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:02,241
why did your daughter
kick you out

1766
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:03,544
of her life forever?

1767
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:05,245
In your face.

1768
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,613
And you know what,
I have done horrible stuff

1769
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:08,581
to my daughter,
really horrible shit.

1770
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:11,785
And she has never
kicked me out. Never.

1771
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:14,420
So you just take that
and you roll it up real tight

1772
01:18:14,422 --> 01:18:17,391
and you shove it up your ass.

1773
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,893
<i>Okay.</i>

1774
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:24,098
We've all shared some very
powerful feelings tonight.

1775
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,465
Oh, shut the fuck up, Sandy.

1776
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:26,469
You bet.

1777
01:18:43,653 --> 01:18:45,919
- Hey.
- Hey.

1778
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,254
Well, I heard what happened.

1779
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:49,525
<i>Hmm.</i>

1780
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,695
You doin' okay?

1781
01:18:55,096 --> 01:18:56,432
I don't know.

1782
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:00,933
Can I ask you something?

1783
01:19:00,935 --> 01:19:02,335
Sure.

1784
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:04,370
How do you take it?

1785
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,505
Take what?

1786
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,107
Living with mom.

1787
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:08,942
I mean, s-s-she's so bossy

1788
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,376
and controlling and...

1789
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:12,446
Oh, my God, she's so vain.

1790
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:14,814
I mean, she spends all her time

1791
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:17,351
you know, creating this,
this perfect image of herself

1792
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:19,119
just so she can
lord it over people.

1793
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:21,621
Sweetie, your mom isn't vain.

1794
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:23,823
Oh, come on, she, she wears

1795
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,893
a princess outfit
at least once a month.

1796
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:28,629
You're probably
never gonna believe this.

1797
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:30,967
But your mom is the most
insecure woman I've ever met.

1798
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,901
My mother?

1799
01:19:33,903 --> 01:19:36,135
- Ruth?
- Yes.

1800
01:19:36,137 --> 01:19:39,173
- Redmond? Huh.
- Yes.

1801
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:40,973
She never shows
anyone except for me.

1802
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:45,178
But beneath that tough exterior
is a scared little girl

1803
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,914
whose mom
never really loved her.

1804
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,549
Oh, come on, dad.

1805
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:50,550
You know her mother.

1806
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:51,985
Nothing your mom does

1807
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,420
is ever good enough
for that woman.

1808
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:55,555
She makes your mom
feel worthless

1809
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,758
every single day
of her life.

1810
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,759
So that's why it's
so important to your mom

1811
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:01,695
to make everything perfect.

1812
01:20:01,697 --> 01:20:03,162
It's not because she's vain.

1813
01:20:03,164 --> 01:20:05,198
It's, it's, it's...
You know, it's because

1814
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,433
when someone tells her
she's got the most amazing

1815
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:10,370
Christmas tree on the block, it
makes her feel just for a second

1816
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,106
like she's not worthless.

1817
01:20:12,108 --> 01:20:15,541
Like she's, she's actually
good at something.

1818
01:20:15,543 --> 01:20:17,945
Like she's, like she's loved.

1819
01:20:17,947 --> 01:20:19,879
Why does she take it
out on me then?

1820
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:22,249
Because you know what
she's most insecure about?

1821
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:23,951
Mm...

1822
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:25,288
Bein' a mom.

1823
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:31,724
I-I can't tell you the number
of times she said to me...

1824
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:34,695
"Did I do a good job
raising Amy?

1825
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:37,233
Am I good mother?
Did I screw everything up?"

1826
01:20:38,234 --> 01:20:39,465
She really asked that?

1827
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:41,134
Sweetheart, she loves you

1828
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:42,736
more than anything in the world.

1829
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:45,606
She's just got a...

1830
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:47,406
a deeply fucked up way
of showing it.

1831
01:20:47,408 --> 01:20:49,076
Yeah.

1832
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:52,478
Look, I've been married
to your mother for 36 years.

1833
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,914
Hm.

1834
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:56,950
And she is a pain in the ass
even on a good day.

1835
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:58,652
But you know what?

1836
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:01,120
I love her more now than I did
the day we got married.

1837
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,090
Because I know the real her.

1838
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:08,094
And if you can find it
in your heart to forgive her

1839
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,496
and get to know her
like I know her...

1840
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:15,169
you might just find
that there is a funny

1841
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:19,141
sweet, beautiful person
hiding inside there.

1842
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,175
Did you say "Sweet?"

1843
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:26,515
Okay, a funny, beautiful person
hiding in there.

1844
01:21:29,984 --> 01:21:30,984
Yeah.

1845
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:33,855
Yeah.

1846
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,456
You know where she is?

1847
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,125
It's Christmas Eve.

1848
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:03,016

01:22:21,837 --> 01:22:23,704
Hey, mom.

1855
01:22:23,706 --> 01:22:24,706
Hi.

1856
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,541
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Sandy.

1857
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:30,076
- I'm Kiki's mom.
- Yes, I know.

1858
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:32,045
- Nice to see you again.
- How you doin'?

1859
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:33,379
Hey, wow, look at that.

1860
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:36,383
All of you are here. Okay.

1861
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:38,518
And what are you
doing here, Amy?

1862
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,519
I, um...

1863
01:22:40,521 --> 01:22:42,255
I actually came to apologize

1864
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:44,193
for kicking you out
of the house.

1865
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:49,263
You're my mom,
and that was a little harsh.

1866
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:50,834
It certainly was.

1867
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,333
Yeah.

1868
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,003
Okay.

1869
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:57,336
Hey, psycho bitch

1870
01:22:57,338 --> 01:22:58,871
your daughter just
apologized to you.

1871
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:01,575
You're now supposed to say
"I'm sorry" to her.

1872
01:23:01,577 --> 01:23:03,610
That's the way human beings
talk to each other.

1873
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:04,612
Yeah.

1874
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:12,422
I'm also basically sorry.

1875
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:17,456
Okay, good. That was good.

1876
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:19,394
Now, tell her
what you're sorry for.

1877
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,699
You got this.

1878
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:27,934
It is possible
that I should not

1879
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:31,537
have thrown a secret
Christmas party at your house.

1880
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:33,740
Obviously, you made
an incredible number

1881
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:36,710
of bad decisions
this Christmas as well.

1882
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:42,249
But... for the tiny fraction
of blame that falls on me

1883
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:47,824
I am... I am
generally... apologetic.

1884
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,791
Okay.

1885
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:53,927
Thank you.

1886
01:23:53,929 --> 01:23:55,795
Mom, I know that that was

1887
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,496
really, really hard
for you to say.

1888
01:23:57,498 --> 01:23:59,434
I-it actually really was.

1889
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:05,339
And, um... you know what?

1890
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:07,307
I just, I want you
to know that I finally

1891
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:09,244
understand why you're like this.

1892
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:16,752
And I need you to know...
that I love you.

1893
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,324
What's that supposed to mean?

1894
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:27,130
I don't think
that you're worthless.

1895
01:24:29,465 --> 01:24:31,865
I think you're fucking amazing.

1896
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:33,200
Why are you saying this?

1897
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:35,137
And no matter
what anyone says...

1898
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:39,441
I think you're a great mom.

1899
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:44,978
Really?

1900
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:45,980
Yeah.

1901
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:49,318
Yeah, I loved my childhood.

1902
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:53,122
I did. You gave me everything
that I needed.

1903
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:57,160
And you always pushed me
to do better.

1904
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:01,128
And were you perfect?

1905
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,129
- Yes.
- No.

1906
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:08,067
But none of us are.

1907
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:10,236
So, I just...

1908
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:16,144
I really want you
to know... that you did great.

1909
01:25:18,514 --> 01:25:22,648
That's the nicest thing that
anyone has ever said to me.

1910
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:24,317
I mean, I...

1911
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,821
I actually think that
you're a really wonderful mom.

1912
01:25:27,823 --> 01:25:29,522
I mean, your kids are so happy.

1913
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:32,260
They're so sweet
and they love you so much.

1914
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:37,667
- Thank you.
- I mean, I wish...

1915
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:43,873
I wish I was as close to you
as you are to your kids.

1916
01:25:46,707 --> 01:25:48,610
We still can, mom.

1917
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:55,048
Wow, I'm just not
very good at this, Amy.

1918
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:57,787
But I just love you so much.

1919
01:25:58,854 --> 01:26:02,425
I love you so much. I do.

1920
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:08,562
- God.
- Oh, my God.

1921
01:26:08,564 --> 01:26:10,796
You're a train wreck.

1922
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,700
Well, it's a very complicated

1923
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:15,936
relationship between
a mother and a daughter.

1924
01:26:15,938 --> 01:26:18,104
But these two...

1925
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:19,371
They've got it together.

1926
01:26:19,373 --> 01:26:20,773
- I know. I know, babe.
- Finally.

1927
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:22,608
Yeah. Okay. Here.

1928
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,144
- Do you want some this?
- Yes.

1929
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:27,746
It's okay. It's okay.

1930
01:26:27,748 --> 01:26:28,915
It's okay.

1931
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:30,317
Okay, mom?

1932
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,253
Mom, is it midnight already?

1933
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:34,257
Well, yeah.

1934
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,590
We gotta save Christmas.

1935
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:39,625
Oh, my God. I've been waiting
my whole life for this.

Mom, you really
did a lot of work.

1955
01:27:52,633 --> 01:27:54,537
I had a little help.

1956
01:27:55,804 --> 01:27:57,137
Merry Christmas, children.

1957
01:27:57,139 --> 01:27:59,371
Grandma.

1958
01:27:59,373 --> 01:28:02,675
Oh! Go open your presents.

Lori, Merry Christmas, honey.

1965
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:20,227
- Merry Christmas, Ruth.
- Merry Christmas, Jesus.

1966
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:22,728
Uh, it's, it's Jessie.

1967
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:24,531
Wow, you have
really broad shoulders.

1968
01:28:24,533 --> 01:28:26,098
Amy, feel his shoulders.

1969
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,701
Oh, here we go. Okay, mother.

1970
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:29,568
Thank you. Get in.

1971
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:32,339
Oh, thanks for almost
learning his name.

1972
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:34,243
I love you, girl.

1973
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:39,681
Merry Christmas, Kiki.

1974
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:42,682
Merry Christmas, mom.

1975
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:44,587
Do you like my
Kiki-head pajamas?

1976
01:28:47,756 --> 01:28:50,055
- Sort of.
- Thank you.

1977
01:28:50,057 --> 01:28:51,258
I just wanted to let you know

1978
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:52,892
that I have put the house

1979
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:55,128
next door on the market.

1980
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:56,729
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1981
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:58,197
I really appreciate that.

1982
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,634
I know I can be a little
psycho sometimes.

1983
01:29:00,636 --> 01:29:02,602
And I know you need your space.

1984
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:06,639
Which is why I bought the house
across the street.

1985
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:09,709
No, I'm kidding. I didn't buy
the house across the street.

1986
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:10,876
I bought the house
down the street.

1987
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:12,211
- What?
- No.

1988
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:13,446
I'm gonna move into your attic.

1989
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:15,915
- Mom! Seriously.
- Kiki, what?

1990
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:17,717
Where are you living?

1991
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,454
I'm gonna go back to Bismarck
where I belong.

1992
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:23,490
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1993
01:29:23,492 --> 01:29:24,994
I just...

1994
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:29,332
I really miss your dad
on Christmas.

1995
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:32,232
I do too.

1996
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:33,234
Yeah.

1997
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:36,505
I do too.

1998
01:29:37,471 --> 01:29:39,973
Merry Christmas.

1999
01:29:39,975 --> 01:29:41,344
Merry Christmas, mom.

2000
01:29:52,421 --> 01:29:54,586
Hey, mom,
look what Santa got me.

2001
01:29:54,588 --> 01:29:56,356
A used baseball glove.

2002
01:29:56,358 --> 01:29:57,823
Oh, that's great, buddy.

2003
01:29:57,825 --> 01:29:59,592
I used to have one just like it.

2004
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:04,100
Is that Santa?

2005
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,700
Why would it be Santa, honey?

2006
01:30:06,702 --> 01:30:08,637
Remember, Santa came last night.

2007
01:30:13,675 --> 01:30:15,610
Can I come in?

2008
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,720
Hm.

2009
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:30,990
Um, alright, I know I haven't

2010
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:33,329
been the best mother
in the world.

2011
01:30:35,297 --> 01:30:42,168
But you... somehow just
turned out really good.

2012
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:45,707
Um, and, Carla, I just...

2013
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,377
I wanna be more like you.

2014
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:55,381
So, I've given up gambling...

2015
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:58,050
- Mom.
- On horses.

2016
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:04,926
And I'm gonna pay you back every
cent that I borrowed from you.

2017
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:11,563
- Really?
- Yeah.

2018
01:31:11,565 --> 01:31:13,903
You know, I got a fucking job.

2019
01:31:15,537 --> 01:31:17,437
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No!

2020
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:21,907
They hired me to be in charge
of children's safety.

2021
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:25,879
Why would
they let you do that?

2022
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:27,914
I don't even know
how I passed the drug test.

2023
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:30,683
- Seriously?
- They're crazy.

2024
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:33,119
And with what they're paying me,
I think I can pay you back

2025
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:36,222
in about 245 years.

2026
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:40,626
Wait, does this mean
you're gonna... stick around

2027
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:42,030
for a while?

2028
01:31:43,899 --> 01:31:46,435
If it's cool with you, yeah.

2029
01:31:48,103 --> 01:31:49,103
Mom.

2030
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:52,805
It's all I've ever wanted.

2031
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:55,578
Well, I'll stay
